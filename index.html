			<h2>Unveiling Vulnerabilities: The High Cost of Data Compromise</h2>
			<p>The digital realm is a battlefield, and your personal/work computer is a prime target. Can you afford the consequences if your sensitive data is stolen, destroyed, or held hostage?</p>
			<p>According to the <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/canada-cyber-crime-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR)</a> by CyberEdge Group. It found that 78 percent of Canadian organizations experienced at least one cyberattack within a 12-month period. In 2021, this figure rose to 85.7 of Canadian companies.</p>
			<p>The IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021 focuses on how much organizations lose when a data breach occurs. The average cost for Canadian organizations was $5.4 million in 2021, up from $4.5 million a year before.</p>
