		<h2>What makes OSCP special?</h2>
		<p>- Highly recognized internationally and by the <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/certifications-field-cyber-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Government</a> which states "Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification is considered one of the hardest to obtain due to its difficult exam. Candidates are required to successfully attack and penetrate live machines in a safe, lab environment over a 24-hour period. Because of its hands-on nature, it is intended for penetration testers with strong technical and ethical hacking backgrounds. Prior to attempting the exam, candidates must complete the Penetration Testing training course offered by Offensive Security. Obtaining the certificate also qualifies the recipient for 40 (ISC)2 continuing education credits."</p>
		<p>- Due to the challenging nature of the exam, there are few OSCP certificate holders in the world, so you can count on us for our expert hacking techniques. <br>
		- We are currently the only company in Alberta offering OSCP certified ethical hacking services.</p>
