		<h2>Vulnerability Assessment</h2>
		<p>Estimated Engagement Period: 2-5 business days.</p>
		<p>A high level, non-invasive scan to get potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities for your organization, with report included.</p>
		<p>This service utilizes mostly Passive Information Gathering: Using google and other search tools, and all other public information available to increase attack surface.</p>
		<p>It also involves port and Service Scanning: Using nmap and other automated tools to scan for open ports and find services actively running, find potential public exploits and CVE's without applying them.</p>
		<p>FREE Assessment Offer: For first time engagement with an organization, inquire about a free vulnerability scan!</p>

		<h2>Penetration Testing</h2>
		<p>Estimated Engagement Period: 1-4 weeks.</p>
		<p>A full-scale sophisticated cyber attack simulation with specific targets in mind, with a lot of communication and a detailed report.</p>
		<p>It includes a cyclical process of Scan, Exploit, Repeat: Attempt to apply all potential vulnerabilities found to gain further intel/access, the process gets repeated until no further exploits can be applied.</p>
		<p>Since some public exploits have the risk of bringing down the service, any risky scripts will be checked with your IT Manager prior to running them. This process involves regular communication with your IT department.</p>
		<p>Applicable Areas Include: Internal, External, Web, Mobile, Wi-Fi, Physical, Cloud, and Hardware.</p>

		<h2>Red Team Engagement</h2>
		<p>Estimated Engagement Period: 1-2 months or long term ongoing engagement.</p>
		<p>This process is a bit similar to penetration testing, with some key differences. For example, your organization will need dedicated "blue team" ready against any and all potential attacks from this exercise.</p>
		<p>The attack will be more general instead of having specific targets, and the attack timing, targets will not be communicated prior, simulating real and unexpected attacks to see how your organization reacts and respondes to them.</p>
		<p>This process can be a short term engagement, as well as long term. You can verify your incident response process and find additional insight on how to improve them.</p>

		<h2>Phishing Campaign</h2>
		<p>Estimated Engagement Period: 1-8 weeks.</p>

		<p>We can offer various levels of difficulty, phishing attempts can go from a poorly drafted email trying to give you "free" money, to highly convincing with prior information gathering through social media and other sources.</p>
		<p>Get real statistics and advice, find out how many attempts were successful, and additional advices, and possibly training on what to look out for in order to avoid them, as well as improving your social media policy.</p>

		<p>This can be anything cyber security related, that aren't included in the packages above!</p>
		<p>To list a few examples such as organization/budget Evaluation. Are you spending money in the right places for security? Do you have an effective process? I can provide advice and guidance on how to improve process which results in cost savings.</p>
		<p>Process Automation: Automating certain security processes in the CI/CD pipeline can help spot vulnerabilities early on, which is much easier and cheaper to fix than in production.</p>
		<p>The Sky Is The Limit: Maybe you'd like to organize a hackathon, or a bug bounty program, or need other help in cyber security! Let's have a conversation free of charge.</p>
